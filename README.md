**pflow** is designed to rival LangChain while maintaining the developer experience and type safety that the Pydantic ecosystem is known for. Built on [pydantic-ai](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), it provides a comprehensive toolkit for building complex AI agents from 0 to 100.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Batteries Included
- **Tools**: HTTP, filesystem, vector operations out of the box
- **Memory**: Persistent conversation history and context management
- **Observability**: Built-in tracing with OpenTelemetry
- **Durability**: State persistence and recovery mechanisms
- **CLI**: Complete command-line interface for agent management

### ðŸ”’ Type Safety First
- Full type annotations with comprehensive IDE support
- Modern Python 3.13+ syntax (`A | B`, `dict`/`list`/`tuple`)
- Pydantic models for all public interfaces
- Runtime validation with detailed error messages

### âš¡ Developer Experience
- Async-first design with sync wrappers where appropriate
- Auto-discovery of plugins and tools
- Fast-running comprehensive test suite
- Rich terminal output and debugging

### ðŸ”Œ Extensible
- Plugin architecture inspired by pytest ecosystem
- External libraries can create `pflow-*` extensions
- Type-safe protocol-based interfaces
- Dependency injection with automatic wiring

## Installation

```bash
pip install pflow
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshSzep/pflow.git
cd pflow
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

```python
# Coming soon!
```

## Architecture

pflow follows core principles that ensure scalability and maintainability:

- **Long-Lived Agents**: Persistent objects with integrated memory and tools
- **Immutable State**: Idempotent APIs over stateful operations
- **Fail Fast**: Rich exception context with custom error types
- **Dependency Injection**: Auto-discovery with explicit configuration

For detailed architectural decisions and patterns, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- uv for dependency management

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run linting
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format
```
